## Events home page

I have used Bootstrap and Vue.js
Deployment link

#### By using Bootstrap I achieved

- Container class from Bootstrap (Wrapping/sticking the elements when screen size changes).
- Gutter between the event cards.

#### By using Vue.js I achieved

- Realtime searching (User can enter the event name in search field to get the event filtered).
- Reusability (I created card.js as a component and rendered using for loop over and array of events by passing event as parameter).
